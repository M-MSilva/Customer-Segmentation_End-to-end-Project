## Important notes about the project

This project was built with numerous tools and technologies, this is a summary document. Therefore, if you want to obtain more statistical and computational information see [Google Colaboratory](https://github.com/M-MSilva/Customer-Segmentation_End-to-end-Project/blob/master/jupyter_notebook/Customer_Segmentation.ipynb), to read about the conclusions found about the project, analyze the [Report](https://github.com/M-MSilva/Predict-NBA-player-Points_End-to-end-Project/blob/master/Report/NBA_Project_M_MSilva.pdf). You can also access application created in [Web App](https://customer-segmentation-mm.herokuapp.com/) and see more information of datasets at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data).

## About this project

The objective of this project is to segment customers using a clustering prediction algorithm, in addition we **answer some businesses questions** that are grounded on the jupyter notebook. Also, this is a complete project as we go through several steps of a usual data science project such as data collection, feature engineering, data cleansing, data transformation, data visualization, data analysis, modeling and **cloud deployment**.

## Applications 

The current project can be used to help companies and retailers find out which customers buy, what they buy, how they spend and the like. Through this project, companies can create advertisements or discounts for specific customers. Although this program is part of my personal portfolio, please feel free to use it for studies, repairs and improvements. :call_me_hand:

## Motivation
This project was developed to be part of my personal portfolio and served both to test my skills and for my learning, since countless technologies could be used in it. Despite being an end-to-end project, it still needs some future improvements, such as having a larger and more diverse dataset. :smiley:

## Functionalities

### Developed Web APPs:

* Enter customer data;
* know which client group belongs to;
* Menu;
* About the author;

### Web APP included by Streamlit

* Rerun;
* Automatically update the app when the underlying code is updated;
* Enable wide mode so the app takes up the entire width of the screen;
* Choose by dark or light theme;
* Record a video or audio of the screen;
* Report a bug;
* Get Help;
* About.


## Instructions to run and/or compile the code

### Initial Requirements

The application is already running and it is not necessary to install anything on your machine, however, if you want to run the application locally, you must install the  [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/) language on your machine. In addition, you must have the libraries listed below on your machine.

### Built With

* [Pandas 1.4.1](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/);
* [Imblearn 0.0](https://pypi.org/project/imblearn/);
* [seaborn 0.11.2](https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/0.11.2/);
* [pickle-mixin 1.0.2](https://pypi.org/project/pickle-mixin/);
* [numpy 1.22.2](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/);
* [Streamlit 1.6.0](https://pypi.org/project/streamlit/);
* [scikit-learn 1.0.2](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/);
* [xgboost 0.90](https://pypi.org/project/xgboost/0.90/);
* [Requests 2.27.1](https://pypi.org/project/requests/).

Hosted In:

* heroku


### Running the Code

The installations of the libraries are already explained in the links above, but if you want to be in the same versions I do:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn==1.0.2
```
```bash
pip install streamlit==1.6.0
```
```bash
pip install numpy==1.22.2
```
```bash
pip install pickle-mixin==1.0.2
```
```bash
pip install pandas==1.4.1
```
```bash
pip install imblearn==0.0
```

```bash
pip install xgboost==0.90
```

done, go to the Deploy folder and type:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```


and see the application run on your machine. :open_mouth:
